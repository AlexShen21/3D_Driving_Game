Use w, a, s, d to move the car and r to respawn the car at a checkpoint if needed. 
Drive around the course to hit checkpoints and coins. Try to finish with all the coins and hit the finish line. 
The white walls are the barriers, the green lines are the checkpoints, and the yellow moving blocks are the coins
Barriers will cause you to die but you will be automatically respawned. 
Checkpoints will respawn you at your last saved position.
